				<p>Born and raised in Puerto Rico, Manolo Lopez moved to New York to study design atNYU. While working in product development and design, he frequently hosted privatedinner parties showcasing Latin cuisine from the island and beyond. He yearned to pursue this passion full time, and in 2014, quit his job to found Mofon∙GO NY. He viewed it as a direct response to the lack of authentic Puerto Rican cuisine in today’s food startup scene. Merging his eye for design, training in business and upbringing in food, Mofon∙GOhas been a labor of love from day one.</p>
